//Write a Program to take a positive integer n as input, and find the pivot integer x such that the sum of all elements between 1 and x inclusively equals the sum of all elements between x and n inclusively. Print the pivot integer x. If no such integer exists, print -1. Assume that it is guaranteed that there will be at most one pivot integer for the given input.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n;
    printf("Enter n: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    for (int x = 1; x <= n; x++) {
        int leftSum = x * (x + 1) / 2;
        int rightSum = (n * (n + 1) / 2) - (x * (x - 1) / 2);
        if (leftSum == rightSum) {
            printf("Pivot integer = %d", x);
            return 0;
        }
    }
    printf("Pivot integer = -1");
    return 0;
}
